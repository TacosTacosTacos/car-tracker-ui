## Development process and problem-solving strategy
Before starting the project, I knew that I was going to have issues with Ember.  The framework has very specific expectations regarding how the programmer works with it, and if you go against those expectations, it will act out.  To address this, I decided to start with a relatively simple idea that I could build up.  I wanted to meet MVP, and then build additional features into the website once I was done.  I also experimented with Ember during my free time in order to get an understanding of its limitations.

Once I began to work on the project, as expected, I ran into problems.  My strategy for solving problems was to try to work through them myself as much as possible.  If I felt like I was getting no where, I moved onto another piece of functionality that needed to be completed.  If I still couldn't resolve the problem after going back to it, I entered a ticket.

## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
There are no unsolved problems.  There are features that I ran out of time, so I couldn't implement.

- The NHTSA has an API available for car information.  I partially setup the application to pull the data, but it isn't fully implemented.
- The functionality to delete cars isn't implemented.  It isn't really necessary, but would be a nice to have
- I would like to make some adjustments to the
- Charting of data
- Notifications when a service is needed on a car based on last service
